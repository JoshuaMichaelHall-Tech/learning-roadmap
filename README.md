# Software Engineering Learning Roadmap

Documentation of my learning journey in software engineering, data analysis, and machine learning with a focus on long-term career development and mastery-based learning.

## Philosophy

My learning approach is based on:

- **Mastery-based learning**: Building deep understanding before moving on
- **Fundamentals first**: Creating a solid foundation of core concepts
- **Deliberate practice**: Focused effort on specific skills
- **Strategic skill development**: Aligning learning with career goals
- **Project-based application**: Applying concepts to real-world problems

## Current Focus: Launch School Core Curriculum

The Launch School curriculum focuses on building a solid foundation in programming and web development through a mastery-based approach. Key areas include:

- Programming foundations with Ruby
- Object-oriented design principles
- Database theory and SQL
- Front-end development with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript
- Backend web development with Ruby/Sinatra/Rails
- Networking and HTTP

## Learning Tracks

### 1. Backend Development (Current)
- Ruby programming fundamentals
- Object-oriented design
- SQL and relational databases
- HTTP and web APIs
- Testing methodologies
- Ruby frameworks (Sinatra/Rails)

### 2. Data Analysis & Python (Next)
- Python fundamentals
- Data structures and algorithms
- Pandas and NumPy
- Data visualization
- Statistical analysis
- ETL processes

### 3. Frontend Development
- HTML/CSS fundamentals
- JavaScript programming
- DOM manipulation
- Frontend frameworks
- API integration
- UI/UX principles

### 4. Machine Learning & Finance (Future)
- Linear algebra and calculus
- Statistical methods
- ML algorithms and techniques
- Financial modeling
- Time series analysis
- ML frameworks (TensorFlow/PyTorch)
